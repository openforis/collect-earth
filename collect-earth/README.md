Collect Earth - Augmented Visual Interpretation
=======

## What is Collect Earth?

Collect Earth is a tool that enables data collection through Google Earth. In conjunction with Google Earth, and Google Earth Engine, users can analyze high and very high resolution satellite imagery for a wide variety of purposes, including :
 
  - Support multi-phase National Forest Inventories
  - Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) assessments
  - Monitoring agricultural land and urban areas
  - Validation of existing maps
  - Collection of spatially explicit socio-economic data
  - Quantifying deforestation, reforestation and desertification
 
Its user friendliness and smooth learning curve make it a perfect tool for performing fast, accurate and cost-effective assessments. It is highly customizable for the specific data collection needs and methodologies.
 
The data gathered through Collect Earth is exportable to commonly used formats and can also be exported to Saiku, a tool that facilitates data analysis.

## Where to download the installer!

If you are not interested in the code but rather on the Collect Earth features you might want to run it right away!
[Go to our website](http://www.openforis.org/tools/collect-earth.html) and download the installer directly there. There are versions for WIndows, Mac OS X and Linux 32 and 64. 

## If you have a question!

## Importing in Eclipse

- Import the project using the File->New->Project->Maven->Check out Maven Projects from SCM
- You need to have the M2E Git connector (click on the m2e Marketplace in the dialog and install the "m2e-egit" connector from there if you don't have it already)
- Set the SCM url ``https://github.com/openforis/collect-earth.git`` and follow the import wizard!

## Running from Eclipse (or another IDE)

You can run Collect Earth directly through the IDE. In Eclipse you can use Run->Run Configurations... and then create a new "Java application" configuration.
In the project set `collect-earth-app` and as Main class set `org.openforis.collect.earth.app.desktop.EarthApp`

## Generating the installer

In order to generate the installer you need to have [Bitrock InstallBuilder](https://installbuilder.bitrock.com/) installed in your computer.

Take the file called [maven_settings.xml](https://github.com/openforis/collect-earth/blob/master/collect-earth/maven_settings.xml) (in the root folder ) and save it somewhere in your hard drive ( e.g. in the maven folder located in C:/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/.m2.

Edit that file to use the path of where your InstallBuilder is installed and the credentials for Nexus server (where the rekleases are stored) and Github.

Don't forget to change your settings now in Eclipse so that this file is used Preferences->Maven->User Settings (User settings field)

### First step, prepare the release
Now you can run the maven goal (using the profile __assembly__, which is the one in maven_settings.xml that contains the InstallBuilder parameters) . From Eclipse yu can do this in the main menu Run->Run Configurations...->Maven Build dialog.
Choose ${workspace_loc:/collect-earth/collect-earth-app} as the base directory

> release:clean release:prepare 

### Rollback if this goes wrong
You can run this maven task if there is a problem while preparing the release

> release:rollback

### Second step, perform the release

Now you need to perform the release so that the installers that are generated end up in the nexus server. Also using the __assembly__ profile and ${workspace_loc:/collect-earth/collect-earth-app} as the base directory.

> release:perform

Here you misht need to specify some extra parameters
username (github username)
password (github password)
connectionUrl : scm:git/https://github.com/openforis/collect-earth.git )

If anything goes wrong during this step you can try to fix it and resume the release with this command

> release:perform -rf:collect-earth-installer

# Last step, upload the collectEarthUpdater.xml to the server

This is the file used by Collect Earth to know what is the latest version available.
This step is manual and requires that you have access to the openforis.org website. The file should be accessible at the same location that is pointed out by the file in ./collect-earth-installer/src/main/resources/update.ini , currently the URL used is http://www.openforis.org/newwebsite/fileadmin/installer/collectEarthUpdate.xml
